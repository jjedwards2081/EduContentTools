|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| **KS2 – Computing – Pupils should design, write and debug programs that accomplish specific goals, including controlling or simulating physical systems; solve problems by decomposing them into smaller parts.** | Students create code in Code Builder (Blocks or Python) to control an AI Agent that gathers resources, crafts tools, and builds shelter. Tasks require decomposition of complex goals (e.g., “build a shelter”) into smaller coded steps. | Coding tasks: “Collect wood,” “Craft tools,” “Build shelter.” Debugging prompts when AI misclassifies materials. | **Reinforcement → Mastery** | Observation of code execution; teacher checks for decomposition and debugging strategies. |
| **KS2 – Use sequence, selection, and repetition in programs; work with variables and various forms of input and output.** | Students use loops and conditionals (e.g., “if block = wood then collect”) to automate Agent behavior. | Task 3: “Mine Stone and Coal” uses conditionals to avoid hazards. | **Reinforcement** | Review of student-created code; reflection discussion on logic flow. |
| **KS2 – Use logical reasoning to explain how some simple algorithms work and to detect and correct errors.** | Students must explain why the AI misclassifies or misbehaves and correct their code. | Debugging dialogue: “I don’t think that’s right. Please try again.” | **Mastery** | Teacher prompts: “Explain why the AI made that mistake.” |
| **KS2 – Understand computer networks, including the internet; and the opportunities they offer for communication and collaboration.** | Not directly network-based, but collaboration occurs between human and AI (conceptual networking). | Human–AI collaboration discussion: “Should the AI act on its own or wait for instructions?” | **Introductory** | Group discussion; reflection worksheet. |
| **KS2 – Use technology safely, respectfully, and responsibly; recognise acceptable/unacceptable behaviour.** | Students explore AI ethics and human oversight, discussing responsible AI use. | Reflection task: “Why is human verification important?” | **Reinforcement** | Exit ticket or journal reflection. |
| **KS3 – Computing – Design, use and evaluate computational abstractions that model the state and behaviour of real-world problems and physical systems.** | Students model AI learning processes (classification, verification) through Minecraft’s simulation of real-world problem-solving. | AI training tasks: defining “wood” or “stone” classes. | **Reinforcement → Mastery** | Evaluate whether AI model correctly classifies materials. |
| **KS3 – Use two or more programming languages, at least one text-based, to solve a variety of computational problems.** | Students can switch between Blocks and Python. Python mode allows text-based coding of AI behavior. | Optional Python tasks in Code Builder. | **Reinforcement → Mastery (KS3)** | Evaluate syntax accuracy and logic. |
| **KS3 – Understand simple Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT) and some of its uses in circuits and programming.** | Students apply conditional logic in AI coding (e.g., “if stone AND not lava”). | Mining challenge uses Boolean logic to avoid hazards. | **Introductory → Reinforcement** | Observation of code structure. |
| **KS3 – Understand how instructions are stored and executed within a computer system.** | The AI Mentor explains how the Agent “learns” from coded instructions and data inputs. | AI dialogue: “I learned from your example.” | **Introductory** | Class discussion or written reflection. |
| **KS3 – Undertake creative projects that involve selecting, using, and combining multiple applications to achieve challenging goals.** | Players use Minecraft, Code Builder, and in-game tools to design and automate survival systems. | Extension: “AI Build Challenge” (design a new AI mini-agent). | **Mastery** | Student-created AI agent evaluated by peers. |
| **KS3 – Understand a range of ways to use technology safely, respectfully, responsibly and securely, including protecting online identity and privacy.** | Ethical reflection on AI use and human responsibility. | Discussion: “What are the risks if AI acts without oversight?” | **Reinforcement** | Reflection journal or class debate. |
