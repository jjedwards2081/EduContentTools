# **Parent Guide: Minecraft Education – *Hour of AI: The First Night***

Welcome! This guide is designed to help you understand what your child will experience and learn while playing **Minecraft Education: Hour of AI – The First Night**, and how you can support their learning at home.  

---

## **1. OVERVIEW**

### **What is this game about?**
*Hour of AI: The First Night* is a special version of Minecraft Education designed to introduce students to **artificial intelligence (AI)** and **coding** through a fun survival adventure.  

Players begin in a familiar Minecraft world and meet a friendly **AI mentor** who needs their help to “learn” how to survive the first night—by gathering wood, crafting tools, and building shelter. As your child plays, they use **coding** to teach the AI helper how to recognize materials, make tools, and solve problems.

It’s a blend of **storytelling, survival gameplay, and hands-on coding**, all in one engaging experience.

---

### **Why is this educational?**
This game transforms playtime into a learning experience by connecting **Minecraft’s creative world** with real-world concepts in **computer science** and **AI literacy**.  

Children don’t just play—they learn **how AI systems work**, **how to code**, and **why human judgment is important** when using technology. Through experimentation and reflection, they develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and digital citizenship skills.

---

### **What will my child learn?**
During the session, your child will:
- **Understand how AI learns and makes decisions** using data and feedback.  
- **Write simple code** (using visual blocks or Python) to guide an AI assistant.  
- **Debug and test** their programs to improve accuracy.  
- **Reflect on human–AI collaboration** and the importance of ethical technology use.  
- **Build confidence** as they see their code come to life in Minecraft.  

---

## **2. HOW TO SUPPORT YOUR CHILD**

### **Discussion questions to ask**
After your child plays, try asking:
1. *What did your AI helper learn to do?*  
2. *How did you teach it using code?*  
3. *Did the AI make any mistakes? How did you fix them?*  
4. *Why do you think humans still need to check AI’s work?*  
5. *Where have you seen AI in the real world (like voice assistants or recommendation apps)?*

These questions encourage reflection and help your child connect their in-game learning to real-world technology.

---

### **Ways to extend learning at home**
- **Explore coding tools together:** Try free beginner coding platforms like Microsoft MakeCode or Scratch.  
- **Spot AI in daily life:** Talk about how AI powers things like search engines, photo filters, or smart devices.  
- **Creative challenge:** Ask your child to design their own “AI helper” in Minecraft or draw a real-world problem an AI could help solve.  
- **Read or watch:** Look for age-appropriate videos or books about how computers “learn” (for example, how robots sort recycling or recognize faces).  

---

### **Connections to real-world topics**
This activity builds awareness of how **AI influences everyday life**—from digital assistants to self-driving cars. It also helps children understand that **AI is created and guided by people**, and that human responsibility, fairness, and creativity are essential in building technology that benefits everyone.
