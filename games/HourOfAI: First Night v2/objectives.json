        "### Refined Learning Objectives",
        "**1. Understand and identify types of AI**",
        "- **Objective:** Students will **differentiate between rule-based systems, machine learning models, and generative AI** by building in-game examples or identifying AI types used in Minecraft NPCs or agents.",
        "- **Measurable Outcome:** Given three in-game scenarios, students will correctly classify each as a rule-based, learning, or generative AI system with at least **80% accuracy**.",
        "- **Standards Alignment:**",
        "- *ISTE 1.1 Empowered Learner:* Students articulate how technology works.",
        "- *CSTA 1B-NI-05:* Discuss ways computing devices impact everyday life.",
        "---",
        "**2. Apply computational thinking to model AI behaviors**",
        "- **Objective:** Students will **use computational thinking (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithm design)** to create a Minecraft agent that follows defined behavioral rules (e.g., pathfinding, item sorting).",
        "- **Measurable Outcome:** Students will design and code an agent that executes at least **three distinct rule-based behaviors** aligned with their algorithmic plan.",
        "- **Standards Alignment:**",
        "- *ISTE 5.4 Innovative Designer:* Develop, test, and refine prototypes.",
        "- *CSTA 2-AP-10:* Use flowcharts or pseudocode to represent algorithms.",
        "---",
        "**3. Train and evaluate AI models**",
        "- **Objective:** Students will **collect and label data in Minecraft (e.g., block types, mob behaviors)** to train a simple AI model and assess its accuracy using test inputs.",
        "- **Measurable Outcome:** Students will generate a labeled dataset of at least **20 samples**, train a model, and report the model\u2019s **accuracy rate and sources of error**.",
        "- **Standards Alignment:**",
        "- *ISTE 4.6 Computational Thinker:* Develop and test solutions using data.",
        "- *CSTA 3A-DA-11:* Create and refine computational models using data.",
        "---",
        "**4. Transfer AI learning across contexts to collaborate effectively**",
        "- **Objective:** Students will **apply insights from one AI challenge (e.g., pathfinding)** to a new challenge (e.g., resource gathering) and **collaborate in teams** to propose improved solutions.",
        "- **Measurable Outcome:** In teams, students will document two cross-task insights and present a shared improvement plan that demonstrates **knowledge transfer** and **collaborative problem-solving**.",
        "- **Standards Alignment:**",
        "- *ISTE 7.7 Global Collaborator:* Use digital tools to broaden perspectives and work effectively in teams.",
        "- *CSTA 2-IC-21:* Discuss issues of equity, access, and influence of computing.",
