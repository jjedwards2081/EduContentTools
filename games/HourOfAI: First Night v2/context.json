They gain hands-on experience coding in Minecraft\u2019s Code Builder, connecting abstract AI ideas to concrete in-game actions.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Setting**\n**World Environment:**  \nA reimagined *Minecraft: First Night* survival world designed for learning and experimentation. Players spawn in a lush, procedurally generated valley surrounded by forests, rivers, and caves. The familiar goal of surviving the first night\u2014gathering resources, crafting tools, and building shelter\u2014becomes the framework for exploring how AI can assist in problem-solving.  \n\n**Scenario:**  \nPlayers encounter a friendly **AI mentor**\u2014a virtual guide that communicates through on-screen dialogue and prompts. The AI introduces itself as a \u201clearning system\u201d that needs the player\u2019s help to understand the world. As students progress, they teach the AI to perform tasks (e.g., collecting wood, identifying ores, or crafting torches) using code.  \n\nEach challenge blends survival gameplay with coding exercises:\n1. **Gathering Resources:** Students write or modify code to help the AI recognize materials.  \n2. **Crafting Tools:** Students use logic blocks or Python to automate crafting sequences.  \n3. **Building Shelter:** The AI applies learned patterns to assist in construction.  \n4. **Surviving the Night:** Players and AI collaborate to stay safe, reinforcing the importance of human oversight and testing AI accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Target Audience**\n- **Ages:** 8\u201318  \n- **Grade Levels:** Upper elementary through high school  \n- **Appropriate Settings:** Classroom computer labs, after-school coding clubs, or informal learning workshops.  \n\nThe experience scales to different skill levels: younger learners can use block-based coding, while older or more advanced students can explore Python scripting and deeper AI logic.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Duration**\n- **Estimated Time to Complete:** 45\u201360 minutes (one class period or \u201cHour of Code\u201d session)  \n- **Extension Opportunities:**  \n  - Additional 30\u201360 minutes for post-lesson discussion or advanced coding challenges.  \n  - Optional creative mode extension\u2014students design their own AI-assisted survival tool or structure.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Overview**\n**Summary of the Experience:**  \n*Hour of AI: The First Night* transforms the classic Minecraft survival tutorial into an engaging, one-hour introduction to artificial intelligence and coding. Students begin as novice survivors guided by an AI companion that learns alongside them. Through interactive prompts and coding challenges, they teach the AI to recognize materials, automate simple tasks, and make decisions\u2014all while learning how real-world AI systems are trained, tested, and improved.\n\n**What Students Will Experience and Learn:**\n- **Hands-on Coding:** Write and run code using Minecraft\u2019s Code Builder (Blocks or Python).  \n- **AI Concept Exploration:** Understand how AI learns from examples, classifies information, and requires human feedback.  \n- **Collaborative Problem Solving:** Work alongside a virtual AI to complete survival objectives.  \n- **Ethical Reflection:** Discuss the importance of human judgment and responsibility in AI development.  \n- **Confidence Building:** See immediate results of their code in the Minecraft world, reinforcing computational creativity.\n\n**Learning Outcomes:**\nBy the end of the session, students will be able to:\n1. Describe how AI systems use data to make predictions or classifications.  \n2. Demonstrate basic coding skills to automate tasks.  \n3. Recognize the role of human input in guiding and correcting AI behavior.  \n4. Reflect on how AI can enhance, but not replace, human decision-making.\n\n---\n\n### **In Summary**\n*Hour of AI: The First Night* is a guided, story-driven Minecraft Education world that merges the excitement of survival gameplay with foundational lessons in coding and artificial intelligence. It empowers students to become creators and critical thinkers in a digital world\u2014teaching not just how to survive the first night, but how to collaborate thoughtfully with the intelligent systems shaping their future.",
