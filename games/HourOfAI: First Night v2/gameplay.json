Upon spawning, they are greeted by an **AI Mentor**, a friendly non-player character (NPC) that introduces the mission: *to survive the first night and teach an AI helper how to assist with essential survival tasks.*\n\nThe opening dialogue establishes context:\n- The AI Mentor explains that it is \u201cnewly created\u201d and needs the player\u2019s help to learn how to recognize materials, make tools, and respond to environmental challenges.\n- Players are introduced to **Code Builder** (opened with a key press), which allows them to write or assemble code blocks that control the AI\u2019s actions.\n- Tutorial prompts guide players through basic movement, resource gathering, and interacting with the coding interface.\n\nAt this stage, the world feels familiar to Minecraft players, but the presence of the AI Mentor and coding interface signals that this is not a typical survival session\u2014it\u2019s a hybrid of gameplay and learning.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Core Mechanics: Main Gameplay Actions, Interactions, and Systems**\n\n**A. Survival and Resource Mechanics**\n- **Gathering:** Players manually collect wood, stone, and coal through standard Minecraft interactions (breaking blocks, crafting items, and using tools).\n- **Crafting:** Players use crafting tables to create tools, torches, and shelter components, reinforcing logical sequencing and resource management.\n- **Time Cycle:** The day\u2013night cycle creates urgency, motivating players to apply both manual and coded solutions efficiently.\n\n**B. Coding and AI Training**\n- **Code Builder Integration:**  \n  Players open Code Builder to access block-based or Python coding tasks. Each coding challenge relates directly to an in-game need\u2014such as teaching the AI to gather wood, classify resources, or verify crafting outcomes.\n- **AI Learning Simulation:**  \n  The AI Mentor \u201clearns\u201d from player input. For example:\n  - Players define what counts as \u201cwood\u201d by coding a classification rule.  \n  - The AI tests its understanding by identifying blocks in the environment.  \n  - Players debug and refine the code when the AI makes errors.\n- **Agent Interaction:**  \n  The coded **AI Agent** (a companion entity) performs tasks like collecting resources or placing blocks. Players observe, evaluate, and correct its behavior, mirroring real-world AI training and verification cycles.\n\n**C. Collaboration and Reflection**\n- Throughout gameplay, the AI Mentor provides feedback\u2014sometimes praising correct logic, other times prompting players to reconsider their code or assumptions.\n- Chat messages and prompts encourage reflection on key AI concepts such as bias, verification, and the importance of human oversight.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Progression: How Players Advance Through the Experience**\n\nProgression unfolds across **six structured survival tasks**, each combining Minecraft survival goals with an AI literacy concept:\n\n1. **Collect Wood:**  \n   Learn classification by teaching the AI to recognize wood blocks and gather them correctly.\n2. **Craft Tools:**  \n   Apply pattern recognition\u2014understand how different materials combine to form tools and instruct the AI to verify recipes.\n3. **Mine Stone and Coal:**  \n   Use conditional logic to code the AI\u2019s decision-making (e.g., \u201cIf stone, then mine; if lava, stop\u201d).\n4. **Build a Shelter:**  \n   Implement sequencing\u2014programming the AI to place blocks in a specific order to construct a safe structure.\n5. **Light the Area:**  \n   Introduce optimization by teaching the AI to place torches efficiently to prevent mob spawns.\n6. **Reflect and Verify:**  \n   Engage in debugging and evaluation\u2014players review the AI\u2019s performance, identify errors, and discuss how AI systems rely on accurate data and human correction.\n\nEach completed task unlocks the next, with checkpoints ensuring that players understand both the survival and AI concepts before advancing.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Challenges: Key Obstacles, Puzzles, or Problems to Solve**\n\n- **Resource Limitations:** Players must prioritize which materials to collect first, balancing time and safety before nightfall.\n- **AI Misclassification:** The AI may misidentify blocks or perform unintended actions, prompting players to debug and refine their code.\n- **Environmental Hazards:** Nighttime brings hostile mobs, encouraging players to apply problem-solving under pressure.\n- **Logical Puzzles:** Coding challenges require players to construct correct sequences, loops, and conditionals to achieve desired results.\n- **Ethical Reflection:** Dialogues occasionally challenge players to think about AI responsibility and human decision-making (e.g., \u201cShould the AI act on its own, or wait for instructions?\u201d).\n\nThese challenges ensure that learning outcomes\u2014like understanding AI limitations and improving algorithmic logic\u2014are embedded in authentic gameplay moments.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Success Criteria: How Players Know They\u2019ve Completed Objectives**\n\nPlayers receive **clear feedback** through both narrative and system cues:\n\n- **AI Mentor Dialogue:** Positive reinforcement appears when tasks are completed (\u201cThe AI successfully gathered all the wood it recognized!\u201d), while incorrect outputs trigger hints for debugging.\n- **Objective Tracker:** On-screen goals update as each survival and coding milestone is achieved.\n- **Functional Outcomes:** The AI Agent performs the intended behavior correctly\u2014building, collecting, or crafting as coded.\n- **Final Reflection Scene:** At the end of the night, the AI Mentor summarizes what it \u201clearned\u201d from the player\u2019s guidance, prompting a discussion or journal reflection on:\n  - How AI systems depend on data and human oversight.\n  - The importance of testing and iteration in both coding and AI development.\n  - The connection between computational thinking and real-world problem-solving.\n\nCompletion is signified by successfully surviving the night with the AI\u2019s assistance and demonstrating understanding of how human-coded logic shapes AI behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n*Hour of AI: The First Night* blends **Minecraft\u2019s survival gameplay** with **hands-on coding and AI literacy**. Players don\u2019t just survive\u2014they teach, test, and refine an AI companion. Through gathering resources, writing code, and overcoming real-time challenges, learners experience the fundamental principles of artificial intelligence: learning from data, verifying results, and collaborating responsibly with technology.",
