## **STUDENT GUIDE**

---

## 1. 🌟 WELCOME & INTRODUCTION

Welcome, adventurer!  
You’ve just entered **HourOfAI: First Night**, a special Minecraft Education world where **you and your AI Agent** team up to survive your first night and learn how **humans and artificial intelligence (AI)** can work together to solve problems.

In this world, you’ll:
- Gather resources like wood and stone.  
- Craft tools and build a safe shelter before nightfall.  
- Learn how to **code your Agent** using **MakeCode Blocks or Python**.  
- Discover what makes AI systems “smart” — and how they depend on humans for guidance!

By the end of your journey, you’ll understand how curiosity, collaboration, and a bit of coding can help humans and AI achieve amazing things together.  

**Estimated time:** 60–90 minutes  
**Recommended for:** Ages 10–14

## 2. 🧭 GETTING STARTED

### Step 1: Launch the World
1. Open **Minecraft Education**.  
2. From the main menu, choose **Play → View Library → Lessons → Computer Science → Hour of AI: First Night**.  
3. Click **Create World** to begin your adventure.

### Step 2: Learn the Basics
You’ll start in a peaceful area with helpful signs and a **Player’s Guide** book.  
Take your time to explore your surroundings and read all instructions carefully.

### Step 3: Controls Refresher
| Action | Keyboard/Mouse | Touch (Tablet) |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Move | **W, A, S, D** | Drag joystick |
| Jump | **Spacebar** | Tap jump button |
| Look around | Move your mouse | Swipe to look |
| Interact / Use | **Right-click** | Tap and hold |
| Open inventory | **E** | Tap backpack icon |
| Open Code Builder | **C** | Tap the **Agent (Code)** button |

### Step 4: Meet Your Agent 🤖
Your **Agent** is your AI buddy!  
It can help you **collect**, **build**, and **craft** — but only if you give it the right instructions through code.

Think of the Agent as a robot that listens carefully but needs clear directions.  
You’re the human brain behind the AI!

## 3. 🧱 GAME WALKTHROUGH

Your goal is to **survive your first night** by building shelter and learning how to code your Agent.  
Follow these stages to succeed!

### 🌲 **Stage 1: Gather and Craft**
**Objective:** Collect wood and make basic tools.

1. Find a tree and **punch** it to collect wood blocks.  
2. Open your inventory (**E**) and craft **wooden planks**.  
3. Craft **sticks** and then a **crafting table**.  
4. Use the table to make a **wooden pickaxe**.  

💡 *Tip:* Break logs, not leaves — logs give you wood for crafting!

---

### ⛏️ **Stage 2: Mine and Smelt**
**Objective:** Gather stone and make stronger tools.

1. Use your wooden pickaxe to mine **stone**.  
2. Craft a **stone pickaxe** and **furnace**.  
3. Use the furnace to smelt materials.  

💡 *Tip:* Furnaces work like real machines — they need **fuel (coal or wood)** and **input (ore or food)**.

---

### 🏠 **Stage 3: Build Shelter Before Nightfall**
**Objective:** Build a safe space to protect yourself.

1. Choose a flat area to build.  
2. Use planks, stone, or dirt blocks to make walls and a roof.  
3. Craft **torches** to light your home (coal + stick).  

💡 *Tip:* Light keeps monsters away — place torches inside and around your shelter!

---

### 🤖 **Stage 4: Code with Your Agent**
**Objective:** Teach your AI Agent to help you.

1. Press **C** (or tap the Code button) to open **Code Builder**.  
2. Choose **MakeCode Blocks** (for beginners) or **Python** (for coders).  
3. Try simple commands like:
   - **Agent move forward**  
   - **Agent place block**  
   - **Agent collect all**

4. Watch how the Agent responds. Did it follow your plan?  
   If not, adjust your code — you’re training your AI!

💡 *Tip:* AI learns from **your instructions**. When you debug your code, you’re improving your AI’s accuracy — just like real developers do.

---

### 🌅 **Stage 5: Survive and Reflect**
If you’ve built your shelter, crafted tools, and coded your Agent, congratulations — you survived your first night!  
Now it’s time to think about what you and your AI accomplished together.

## 4. 💡 LEARNING POINTS

| Concept | What It Means | How You’ll Practice It |
|----------|----------------|-----------------------|
| **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** | A computer system that can make decisions or learn from data. | Your Agent acts like an AI that follows your code and improves through testing. |
| **Coding & Algorithms** | A list of steps (instructions) a computer follows. | You’ll write code using sequences, loops, and conditionals. |
| **Computational Thinking** | Breaking problems into smaller steps to solve them logically. | You’ll plan how to gather, craft, and build efficiently. |
| **Human–AI Collaboration** | Humans guide AI systems to perform tasks safely and fairly. | You’ll direct your Agent and check its results, just like a responsible AI trainer. |
| **Debugging** | Finding and fixing mistakes in your code. | You’ll test your Agent’s actions and edit commands when needed. |

---

## 5. ⚙️ CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS

| Challenge | Possible Cause | How to Solve It |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| My Agent won’t move! | Code might be incomplete or facing a block. | Check your code: Did you tell it to move forward? Is there space ahead? |
| I can’t craft something. | Missing ingredients. | Open your inventory and check if you have all materials. |
| Night is coming and I’m not ready! | Time moves fast in Minecraft. | Focus on crafting a simple dirt or wood shelter first — upgrade later! |
| My code gives an error. | A command might be misspelled or missing. | Recheck your syntax or switch to Block view if you’re using Python. |
| Agent built in the wrong place. | Incorrect coordinates or direction. | Use `agent.turn left()` or `agent.turn right()` before placing blocks. |

Remember: mistakes are **part of learning**. Every time you debug, you’re thinking like a computer scientist!

## 6. 🧠 REFLECTION QUESTIONS

Think about these as you play (or discuss them afterward):

1. How did you and your Agent work together to survive the night?  
2. What challenges did you face when coding your Agent, and how did you solve them?  
3. What makes your Agent like real-world AI systems?  
4. Why is it important for humans to guide and check AI decisions?  
5. If you could train a real AI helper, what job would you give it — and how would you make sure it behaves responsibly?
