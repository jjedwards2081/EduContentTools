They learn about different types of AI, practice training and verifying AI outputs, and apply computational thinking to design and refine AI behavior using coding principles.\n\n**Setting:**  \nA survival-themed Minecraft Education world where students partner with an AI Agent to endure their first night. The environment includes natural resources, crafting areas, and building zones that encourage exploration, problem-solving, and coding-based interaction with the Agent.\n\n**Target Audience:**  \nUpper elementary to middle school students (ages 10\u201314) with basic familiarity with Minecraft gameplay. No prior coding experience is required, though an introduction to MakeCode Blocks or Python is beneficial.\n\n**Duration:**  \nApproximately 60\u201390 minutes, depending on class pacing and coding experience.\n\n**Overview:**  \nStudents collaborate with an AI Agent to gather resources, craft tools, and build shelter before nightfall. Through guided coding challenges in MakeCode Blocks or Python, they apply concepts such as sequences, loops, and debugging while learning how AI systems rely on human input and oversight. By the end of the session, learners transition from novice adventurers to capable mentors, demonstrating how curiosity, collaboration, and code can empower both humans and AI to succeed together.",
